# SM64Plus Web Browser Port PoC

This is a fork of SM64Plus that attempts to make it playable in the web browser

### AS OF 5/11/24, 

only the launcher is useable, and the game itself isn't.
- If I can get the game working along with the launcher, it will be on a different github repo, and this one will be archived (no promises)
- Why that is the case is because this one will contain the launcher itself (as the files fit within Github's Limit), while the other one will be too big for Github
